# Project Introduction

I am trying to consolidate all different experts' work and we can have some agreement about co-work model and data exchange. The main purpose of this project is that make experts focusing on their professional.

## About Design Stages

Different people have differnet options on design stages and also different companies have different structures. Here I am going to centralize some tasks based on design cycle.

- TBD
- Verification
- Design For Test (DFT)
- Synthesis (Logic Synthesis)
- Backend (Physical Implenmentation)
  - Floorplan
  - Placement
  - Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS)
  - Route
- Signoff
  - Static Timing Analyze (STA)
  - Physical Verification (PV)
  - Tapeout

From the tree above, for example, STA is in Signoff part, but some teams take it into Synthesis and some teams take it into Backend.

From my opinion, for implenmatation we have logic and physical work which would be done by synthesis guys and backend guys. But STA and PV could also be done by these engineers, they are both check steps, not implenmation steps. And also these steps has a lot of interaction between different teams.
