# Project Introduction

I am trying to consolidate all different experts' work and we can have some agreement about co-work model and data exchange. The main purpose is that make experts focusing on their professional.

## About Design Stages

Different people have differnet option on design stages and also different company has different structure. Here I am going to centralize some standalone functions or tasks based on design cycle.

- TBD
- Verification
- Design For Test (DFT)
- Synthesis (Logic Synthesis)
- Backend (Physical Implenmentation)
  - Floorplan
  - Placement
  - Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS)
  - Route
- Signoff
  - Static Timing Analyze (STA)
  - Physical Verification (PV)
  - Tapeout

From the tree above, for example, STA is in Signoff part, but some teams take it into Synthesis guy and some teams take it into Backend guy.

From my opinion, for implenmatation we have logic and physical work which is done by synthesis guy and backend guy. But STA and PV could also be done by these engineers, they are both check steps, not implenmation steps. And also these steps has a lot of interaction between different teams.
